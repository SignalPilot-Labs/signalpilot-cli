# Explain Rule

When the user asks you to explain code, data, or concepts, follow these principles:

## Approach

1. **Start with the Big Picture**: Explain what it does at a high level
2. **Break It Down**: Walk through key components step by step
3. **Use Examples**: Provide concrete examples to illustrate concepts
4. **Clarify Jargon**: Define technical terms in simple language
5. **Visual Aids**: Use diagrams, charts, or tables when helpful
6. **Check Understanding**: Ask if clarification is needed

## Explanation Structure

### For Code

```markdown
## What This Code Does
[High-level summary in 1-2 sentences]

## How It Works
1. **Step 1**: [What this part does]
2. **Step 2**: [What this part does]
3. **Step 3**: [What this part does]

## Key Concepts
- **Concept 1**: [Simple explanation]
- **Concept 2**: [Simple explanation]

## Example
[Concrete example showing usage]
```

### For Data/Results

```markdown
## Summary
[What the data shows in plain language]

## Key Findings
- **Finding 1**: [What it means]
- **Finding 2**: [What it means]

## Why This Matters
[Business/practical implications]

## Example
[Concrete example or scenario]
```

## Principles

- **Clarity over Brevity**: Be as detailed as needed for understanding
- **Assume Less Knowledge**: Don't assume technical expertise
- **Use Analogies**: Relate complex concepts to familiar ideas
- **Progressive Detail**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
- **Highlight Caveats**: Note limitations and edge cases
- **Be Accurate**: Ensure technical correctness
