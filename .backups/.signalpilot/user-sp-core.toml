# SignalPilot Core Configuration (User Overrides)
# This file allows you to override default settings.
# Only include settings you want to change from defaults.
# See defaults/sp-core.toml for all available options.

# Example overrides (uncomment and modify as needed):

# [jupyter]
# lab_port = 8889  # Use a different port
# open_browser = false  # Don't auto-open browser

# [agent]
# temperature = 0.1  # Slightly more creative responses
# confirm_mutations = false  # Don't ask for confirmation

# [logging]
# level = "debug"  # More verbose logging
